When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?
When you are working remotely or working with a team.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?
Conflicts or overwriting a file might occur

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you use one instead of another?
Fork is another copy of a repository that all commits will not affect the original.
Clone is a copy of a directory that can be edit and commit.
Branch is a copy of the current version of the repository but separates itself from the master branch.
Use fork when you want to copy other user's repository and make own changes.
Use clone when you want to download a copy to a local machine.
Use branch when you have multiple collaborators working on different features.

What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote stored locally?
Fast forward merge?

How would you collaborate without using Git or GitHub? What would be easier, and what would be harder?
I honestly think wont be anything easier. It will be harder to merge, copy, keeping track of changes, etc.

When would you want to make changes in a separate branch rather than directly in master? What benefits does each approach have?
When you want to implement a new feature or refactoring the code, its better to create a new branch so that we got the working copy running.
